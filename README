IntelDB - a schemaless data storage and retrieval solution

IntelDB is a system for storing and retrieving data even if the pieces of data do not share a common schema.

Caveat: This project was written when I was learning a lot of Ruby-esque things for the first time, I do plan on cleaning it up when I get a chance.

Usage instructions coming soon.
